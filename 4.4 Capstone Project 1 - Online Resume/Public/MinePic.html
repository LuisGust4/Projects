    <h3>What is Minecraft?</h3>

    <p>Minecraft is a hugely popular sandbox video game that allows players to explore, build, and interact with a vast open world made up of blocks. It was created by Markus Persson (also known as Notch) and later developed and published by Mojang Studios.

    In Minecraft, players can gather resources such as wood, stone, and minerals, which they can use to craft tools, build structures, and create elaborate constructions. The game world is procedurally generated and consists of different biomes, including forests, mountains, deserts, oceans, and more.</p>

    <h4>Minecraft offers several modes of play:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Survival Mode: Players must gather resources, manage their health and hunger, and fend off hostile creatures like zombies, skeletons, and spiders.</li>
        <li>Creative Mode: Players have unlimited resources and can fly, allowing for unrestricted building and exploration without the need to gather materials or worry about survival.</li>
        <li>Adventure Mode: Players can explore custom maps created by other players, complete challenges, and interact with complex adventures created by the community.</li>
        <li>Spectator Mode: Players can fly around and observe the world without interacting with it.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Minecraft has a strong community of players who create and share their own custom maps, mods, and game modifications, adding new features and content to the game. Its simple yet versatile block-based graphics and open-ended gameplay have contributed to its enduring popularity across a wide range of age groups.
